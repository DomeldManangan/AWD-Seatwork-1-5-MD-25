## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
This project is a bus reservation system designed to manage the daily operations of a fleet of 3 buses. The system allows users to check seat availability and reserve up to 5 seats at a time, ensuring an efficient and user-friendly booking experience. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the system provides an interactive interface where HTML structures the content, CSS styles the layout for a clean, responsive design, and JavaScript adds interactivity, such as checking seat availability and managing reservations. The system effectively handles the scheduling of buses and checks if 5 seats are available for reservation at any given time, making it easy for passengers to plan their trips in advance. The overall goal of this project is to streamline the reservation process and improve the efficiency of bus travel by offering a simple, reliable platform for users to reserve their seats.
